# Personal landing page

For years I used paid services for a page on my name-domain. I decided to switch to github for several reasons

* More flexibility in what to do with this page
* The possibility to play around with github
* More freedom in what to publish on this domain
* Lower costs of ownership ;-)

The repository resides as a [Github project](https://github.com/frankmeeuwsen/minimum) with thanks to [Oskar van Rijswijk](https://github.com/ovanrijswijk/ovanrijswijk.github.io) for the inspiration. The repo hosts a webpage on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The file ```index.html``` is my minimal personal landing page showing my name, profile image and a few links to information from and about me elsewhere on the web.

The [CSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) is internal in the ```index.html``` file. This style is usable in many browsers and on mobile screens.

My default profilepicture is blended into a set of [favicons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) for this landing page using the online generator made by Eduardo Russo at [Faviconit](http://faviconit.com/en).

##Backlog

* Remove table, make more responsive
* Add icons for social networks using [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* Add links to other sites and pages (like Digging the Digital)
* Decide where to put everything for once and for all (Medium? Ghost? Jekyll? Wordpress?)
