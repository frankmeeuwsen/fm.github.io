# Personal landing page

A ```[myusername].github.io``` repository hosts a webpage on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The file ```index.html``` is my minimal personal landing page showing my name, profile image and a few links to information from and about me elsewhere on the web.

I use the URL [ovanrijswijk.github.io](http://ovanrijswijk.github.io/) in my e-mail signature and in bio fields above my social media.

The [CSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) is internal in the ```index.html``` file. This style is usable in many browsers and on mobile screens.

The cartoon for my profile image is made by Len Peralta via [Flipface.me](http://flipface.me/). I've blended this image into a set of [favicons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) for this landing page using the online generator made by Eduardo Russo at [Faviconit](http://faviconit.com/en).
